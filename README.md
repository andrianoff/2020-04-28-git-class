Git collaboration workshop

- `git clone <URL>`: downloads the repository from the web to our computer
	- make sure you don't nest this command in another repository
	- just like `git init` do this only once per repository
- `git push <where> <what>`: pushes repository to the web from computer

## Branches

- `git branch <branch_name>`: create a new branch
- `git switch <branch_name>`: move to a branch
	-`git checkout <branch_name>`: old way to create a new branch
